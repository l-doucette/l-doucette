## Bonjour/Hello

### The following is a short description of me:  

1. My name is **Luc Doucette**. A suspiciously francophone name for an anglophone, I know.

2. #### Here is (*alledgedly*), a photo of myself:

3. #### It was taken on my last day of work at Vimy Ridge in France, during the summer of 2024. 

4. #### I am majoring in Neuroscience with a minor in Philosophy at Dalhousie University.

5. #### It is currently my fourth of four years of study.

6. #### I am enrolled in this course because I found the prospect of learning Python enticing.

7. #### I initially got interested in neuroscience because I find the idea that we are meat puppets controlled by a 1.3kg blob of fat incredibly odd, yet simultaneously mundane.

8. #### I have been certain for years that my career lies in medicine, and I will likely specialize in a brain-related subject. I do rather enjoy the prospect of spaceflight though. Hopefully I can combine the two. In years to come, maybe I will be:
    Dr. Doucette, the *space doctor*.
